        <p><small>(narration by vashist kannan)</small><br><br>
            <indent></indent>No matter how hard I try to start the story in a funny way or  at least in an intact manner, I get struck at the very start... So it goes like this, ON-CAMPUS interview in our college happens like once in a blue moon and it was the next day. The company who were coming to recruit us was WIPRO, this is the chance to shine, by getting placed in this company I could prove to my parents and mock my professor's who said that I was useless, this was the only thought that roll over everyone's head. Me and my friend were no exception, just to maintain our cool attitude we were acting like it was nothing. Believe me to maintain a false image is the most worst and difficult job.<br><br>
        We both were hostel students, while everyone in the hostel was too busy taking rehearsals for the next day performance which will decide their career. We went out, just to relax our minds. Everyone in the hostel were cursing us that we will never pass the aptitude. To show off ourselves, we planned to go for a beach walk, so we decided to go to Injambakkam. That was the nearest beach that could be thought by us and a Sai baba Temple was near that beach, so it was perfect to get ourselves relaxed.<br><br>
         To reach Injambakkam we had to change two different buses. First We got into a Sholinganallur bus. In the bus, my friend saw a girl in green dress(chudithaar). She was sitting near the driver seat next to an average looking girl wrapped up in a traditional saree, but the girl in green's face was not clearly visible.<br><br>
               As soon as the stop came we rushed to see the green girl's face. "Green girl" that was the name given to that girl by us.......
        But as we saw an Injambakkam bus cross our way, we dropped the idea of seeing her face and ran across the signal to catch the bus.
        The bus started to move, before it could pick up its speed we hopped into the bus....
          Last stop!!! The conductor Shouted. We had to walk around 3km to reach the Sai baba Temple... First we thought we could walk but after walking for 1 km we stopped a share cab. <br><br>
           Two girls and two old school gentlemen were sitting there. I sat near those guys and my friend tried to sit near me but there was not enough space to fit himself in. So he had to sit between the ladies. My friend reacted like he has never been made to sit near a pair of girls, which was actually true, the girls started to laugh at both of us. One was a black beauty and another was somewhat OK. One guy got off the auto and my friend immediately shifted to my side. The girls again smirked at us.<br><br>
         Thinking what made the girls laugh at us, we forgot where we were going......<br><br>
        "The Sai baba Temple" shouted the driver, both me and my friend were into deep thoughts. Only at the third time I heard the driver, but my friend was still into deep shitty thoughts. I woke my friend up from his thoughts. As soon as we got off the auto my friend saw
"The Girl in Green", without second thoughts he went after her. <br><br>
            The driver was asking for the Cab fair, but I didn't have a penny then. I called out his name, at God's grace he turned back and I asked him to pay the fair. He came back and paid the cash. This time, the girls inside the cab were laughing only at me!!!!!<br><br>
             The Girl in green and her friend were also going to the Sai baba Temple. Still we didn't get the chance to see her face.....<br><br>
             We reached the temple, near the cloak room, we saw her face and I Started to laugh at my friend..... I laughed till I my eyes got popped out and my stomach was paining like hell .<br><br>
Everyone upto a certain distance got disturbed by me, in the temple. It was not "The Girl in Green"  but 
"The Aunt in Green". I couldn't stop myself from laughing.<br><br>
             The ultimate troll was when the girl in the Saree called out that Woman as "MOM".........  <br><br>  
              That was the ultimate moment of the day.........  Not once but six times I would have heard her calling out her mother with the word AMMA. Each time was like a knife piercing through my friend's heart.<br><br>
           The girl for who my friend left me in the middle of the road was actually a Mother to a girl, who looked like herself to be a mother to a kid or two..... Grandmother that would be precise go address the Girl in Green......<br><br>
       After this hilarious moment, we went for the beach which was just 200 meters away from the temple.<br><br>
After beach,waves,seashore,sea, we returned to hostel......<br><br>
    The lesson learned was, Never go after a girl by just looking her back or fancy attire because looks can always be deceptive.<br><br>

        <span class="indent"></span>Exams were on the queue, study mode was activated in the entire hostel.<br><br>Everyone woke up early,some even didn't care to sleep, and started to crow like a rooster at midnight.<br><br>9:20 am was the time when I woke up. The time I reached the hostel mess for breakfast, it was closed. <br><br>Returned to my room. Just when I was thinking I'm the only one that missed the breakfast, my dear friend was still on his dreams. Waited for him to wake up in his own, time passed 10:00, 10:30, 11:00, but he was still sleeping like a Egypt Mummy in his/her coffin.<br>I lost my patience, pushed him off the bed. "Who the ****? Did wake me up, blah blah blah" he started to shout.... His abusing word were least of my worries,I was starving.<br><br>I said lets go to the canteen, the mess is closed. Before he could say anything " My treat, I'll pay for both of us".That made him shut.<br><br>11:30 am when we reached the canteen. Ordered all the junks that were on the menu.Before returning to the hostel we bought some backups for our devouring stomach. Our college was so simple, straight road and buildings at the right side of the road while entering the campus.<br><br> After the first two blocks, on the right side, a road extends to the girls hostel, lies the dreams of every boy in the college. Every time we cross this road of dreams, we expect some beauty to show up but it never happened because there were no such well crafted sculptures in our college that we could say "She is too hot man....". Even though, you how boys are, we follow the quotes"Something is better than Nothing". <br><br>
                 We always look out for some pretty faces to show up near the girls hostel road. "No one......." I said<br><br>
Friend. : Wait... There is a girl near the B.Arch block. <br>
Me       : Where I can't find anyone...<br>
Friend : See there, left side of the road, near to that heap of sand.<br>
Me         : That yellow Chudithar. Yes, now I can see her.<br>
Friend : But I can't see her face.<br>
Me       : I can't see her face too.<br>
Friend : Why is she sitting near the B.Arch block.<br>
Me.      : How do I know? Lets ask her.<br>
Friend : How about we bet on that girl?<br>
Me.      : I don't think that she is worth for a bet.<br>
 Friend : OK, then this is the bet. I say that girl is beautiful.<br>
Me.       : How do you know that if she is beautiful or not?<br>
Friend : My intuitions. Are you on?<br>
Me.      : Whatever but I think that she is not that much of a beauty.<br>
Friend : Lets see... Are you on for the bet?<br>
Me.      : Ok I'm on. But what does the winner get.<br>
Friend : Whatever task the winner gives, loser must do it?<br>
Me.      : That's it.. I thought it would be a cash prize. But its fine with me.<br>
Friend : She is reading a book.I think she preparing for the model exam.<br>
Me.       : Yes, her concentration is extraordinary. Not even moved an inch since we saw her.<br>
Friend : Yeah. The rose on her head is superb, don't you think so....<br>
<small>(About 300 meter was the distance between the girl and us)</small>
Me        : How could say that it's a rose from this distance. It could be her hair band too.<br>
Friend : I know how a hair band looks like. That one is definitely a rose.I'm sure of it.<br>
Me.      : Whatever......<br>
<br><br>
<small>(It's been an hour and still that girl didn't bother to move from there, we were sitting in the stone bench near the pavement. Boys were not allowed to cross the girls hostel road during holidays, so we waited for the girl to stand and show her face. But still no sign of movement)</small>
<br><br>
Me.      : Hey I'm starving, or we'll miss the lunch too. Let's go to hostel. <br>
Friend : Finish up those junks that we bought. We'll buy more if needed. I just need to see her face.<br>
Me.       : Why don't we enter the A-Block  and exit via the back entrance that will lead to the girls hostel road.<br><br>
<small>( The girls hostel road lies in between two blocks, A and B. A block has two entrances and one of the entrance leads to the girls hostel road.)</small><br><br>
Friend : Super, lets do that...Why didn't you think of it before.<br>
Me.      : Just got the idea. Quick, we have wasted 2 hours to see the girl's face better be worth it.<br>
Friend : Don't worry she'll be awesome. Trust my intuition.<br>
<br><br>
<small>( We Entered the A-Block, but unfortunately the way for the back entrance was closed, we returned back. Waited another half an hour)</small>
<br><br>
Me.      : Let's go, we have wasted enough time on her. I'll give up, you won lets go..<br>
Friend : No, wait. Someone is coming towards that girl. She'll definitely move from there. Please let wait for him to come.<br>
Me.       : The gardener is coming towards her. OK, lets wait.<br><br>
The moment he reached the girl, My friend had an severe heart attack and I was literally laughing to death........
The girl which we saw, the girl who we thought to be a girl, turned out to be a disaster. It was not a girl neither a boy neither a human being not even a living organism.It was the Gardener's Yellow TVS Apache Bike. We both were so dumb that we thought it was a girl. Actually we were not dumb but blind.We just recalled how did we decide that it was a girl...... The bike was after the heap of sand, so it was not clear only few parts were visible.<br><br> First, the yellow body became the Chudithar, the rear edge became the head and hair,the number plate became the book that she was studying and finally the danger light became the ROSE.... This was our extraordinary imagination that made us bet on a bike thinking that it was a beautiful girl,turned out not to be even a Granny or even a living creature.....<br><br><br>
                     The next day we passed the exam, that was the only relieving thing that had happened that week....... 
            This is a real story with little salt and pepper on it.... Hope you enjoy it.</p>
